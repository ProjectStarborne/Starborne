I don’t know how we’re supposed to pull through this time. Honestly, I think we might be done for. You can see it in everyone’s eyes—the fear, the exhaustion. Even the ones who used to crack jokes to keep us going have gone quiet.

People are losing hope—more whispers about that other planet. \"We should’ve gone with them,\" they say. Like chasing some fantasy would’ve solved anything. But I’m not an idiot. I’m not gambling my family’s safety on some fever dream of a better place.
No, I’ve made my choice. I’ve stayed the course, kept my head down, done the work. TERRA will come through. They have to. They wouldn’t just leave us out here to die—not after everything we’ve done for them.

I don’t know if I believe it anymore, Catherine. I keep telling myself you’ll see me again, that I’ll make it back to you. But tonight, it’s harder to say those words and mean them.

Catherine, I’m holding on for you. Just a little longer. I’ll see you soon. I promise."

They promised us safety, security, a future. They lied. All they care about is their quotas. To them, we’re just tools—things to use and discard when we’ve worn down. The air’s choking us, the food tastes like dirt, and the only thing keeping this cave from caving in is dumb luck.
And still, it’s always, \"Dig deeper. Mine faster. Hit the numbers.\" They don’t care if we’re starving. They don’t care if we’re dying. As long as the resources keep flowing, we don’t matter.

Some of the others keep talking about Planet Alpha 12. Saying we should’ve gone there when we had the chance. Maybe they’re right. Maybe we could’ve had a real shot at something better. But it doesn’t matter now, does it? We’re stuck here, and TERRA owns every piece of us.

ANYONE READING THIS: DO NOT RISK YOUR LIFE FOR THIS.

I don’t know where Jack is. His life readings… they’re just gone. I’ve searched everywhere I can but it’s no use. He’s not coming back.

I wish I could wait longer, but I can’t. If I don’t meet the quota, I might as well not come back at all. TERRA doesn’t forgive failure, and I can’t afford to let them down—not when everything I’ve worked for is on the line.

This planet… it’s nothing like the ones we’ve seen before. It’s harder to navigate, and every step feels like it could be your last. There’s something about it that’s off. The terrain is brutal, and every corner feels more dangerous than the last.
It’s no place for anyone, let alone Jack, but he wouldn’t listen. He always had to see things for himself.

Jack, if you somehow see this… if you’re still alive in there… I’m sorry. I wish I could’ve stopped you from going in, wish I could’ve done more. But I can’t throw my life away too.

I’m taking the ship. I have to leave. I have no choice.

Goodbye, Jack."

But my damn teammate—he just left. Didn’t even say a word. I don’t get it. Why would he leave now, when everything’s finally clicking?

Now I’m down here, alone, and I don’t know how I’m going to make it out. The cave’s messing with my head. The heat’s unbearable, and it’s making everything feel off. My body’s dizzy, and I can’t seem to catch my breath right. The walls are closing in on me, and it’s like the air’s thickening with every step.

I thought I could handle this—thought I could keep my head together. But now? Alone in this hellhole? It feels like I’m losing control, like this place is trying to swallow me whole.

If I don’t make it out of here… just know I tried.

For those that seek the escape I may not have:
