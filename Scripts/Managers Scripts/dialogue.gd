		responsible for Asteroid 0923-D. TERRA admin said you'd be landing here for onboarding. 
		According to TERRA company policy 1.3.4-B , I will go over the daily tasks that you will 
		be responsible for while you search for our new home.",

		months. To navigate the vast expanse of space, you have your navigation terminal. 
		The terminal is set to autopilot, so you just have to select a location and wait 
		for your ship to land.",
		2 : "Overseer: It seems your ship is an older model. You should make sure to upgrade your 
		ship when you can afford it at the same terminal.",
		3 : "Overseer: On the port side, you have the shop. This is your go-to for any tools and 
		upgrades you may need on your trip. Any ores you mine will be sold through the shop, as well.",
		4 : "Overseer: On the starboard side, you have your storage locker. You will store any tools 
		and ores you don't need on your person.",
		5 : "Overseer: The procedure for asteroid mining is as follows: \"Find, Mine, and Sell. 
		Do not deviate from your mission.\"",
		6 : "Overseer: Iâ€™ll need to attend to my own work, so the others will teach you the rest. 
		The medical team is to the right. The lead engineer below them. Good Luck!"
